**Your challenge…**

Navigate to [http://www.thegreatcourses.com](http://www.thegreatcourses.com) and create a Javascript snippet that will modify what a visitor sees on the product categories pages, where many products are listed. You must display a message to the visitor that a product in their cart has “Limited Inventory” (imagine you have prior knowledge that this is the case, we don’t expect you to find an inventory API).

**Challenge requirements:**

* **Script output:**
 * The message can be a physical display appending to the HTML and CSS of the website (slider, modal, inline), or data output to console.

* **Display Conditions**
 * *Objective*: Display the price of one item in the visitor’s cart. If you opt for a physical display on the page, then also displaying product image and product title are nice to haves.
 * *Sale Condition*: If the item is on sale, both sale and full price must be shown.
 * *Coupon Condition*: If the item is not on sale, only show the full price and offer a “coupon” (fake) to the visitor.

**The Format**

Write as many files as you see fit (Javascript, HTML and/or CSS), and how you choose to design & implement this task is your choice. Assume you have a “one script fires all” installed on the site that we will run on every page and carries out the task(s) you implemented. Submit your file(s) either via e-mail attachment or hosting and giving us a link.

**Hints**

* The Great Courses uses Tealium Tag Manager. We don’t expect you to understand what or how this is used, however, it means there is a property on the site (utag) where you may be able to get data to help you out.
* Consider a visitor’s “journey” throughout the site. If information you need is not available on the category page for a particular item, is there a way you could get the information at another location sometime?
* You will not necessarily be evaluated on HTML/CSS, but if you feel like showing off your stuff, feel free! Do not get discouraged if you struggle with any part of this challenge. While working code is preferable, if you are stuck but have a clear idea of how you would tackle the tasks, a supporting description and pseudocode of your thought process will help us understand your way of working.
